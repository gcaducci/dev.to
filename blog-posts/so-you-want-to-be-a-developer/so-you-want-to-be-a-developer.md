# Who am I and what my goal is?

I have been a software developer for 10+ years, I started my career as a web developer in late 2000 and currently, I am working as IT Team Leader at EBANX for almost a year.

Writing articles was something that I wanted to do for a long time but always had some excuse to not do it. A couple of days ago, in the middle of the COVID-19 lockdown, one of my cousins asked me to teach him how to code. So this is the beginning of my path as a writer, it will help me to grow as a developer and in meanwhile, I believe, that this can also help others seeking to start coding.

# What we are about to do

To help me fulfill the task given to me by my cousin, I started to do some research on what to teach first. Should I start on how to create a web site? or how create a simple software? How to do a calculator? HTML, CSS and JavaScript combo?

After a while searching in what to do first, I came across with the [Web Developer Roadmap 2020](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap) from [Kamran Ahmed](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse) and I think that it is a great starting point.

In the next post we are going to see **Data Structures and Algorithms**.
